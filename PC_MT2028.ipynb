    "Python provides many excellent modules to measure the statistics of a program. The first step toward a fast implementation of a program is profiling to find out where your code spends its time. The key point is to only optimize functions that are actually slow or are called extensively. Profilers can collect several types of information: timing, function calls, interruptions, cache faults… In our case, we are going to focus our attention on timing and function calls.\n",

    "Types of profiling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic Profiling: All events are monitored. It provides accurate information but has a big impact on performance. It means the code run slower under profiling. Its use in production systems is often impractical. This type of profiling is suitable for small functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical profiling: Sampling the execution state at regular intervals to compute indicators. This method is less accurate, but it also reduces the overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with two modules for deterministic profiling: cProfile and profile. Both are different implementations of the same interface. The former is a C extension with relatively small overhead, and the latter is a pure Python module. As the official documentation says, the module profile would be suitable when we want to extend the profiler in some way. Otherwise, cProfile is preferred for long-running programs. Unfortunately, there is no built-in module for statistical profiling, but we will see some external packages for it."
